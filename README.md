#  DTSA-5509 Likelihood of Cervical Cancer Based on Health Factors
6/27/2023

# Introduction

Cervical cancer is a type of malignant growth that occurs in the cells of the cervix, the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. It's primarily caused by persistent infection with certain strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) (American Cancer Society, 2021[1]). The potential impact of cervical cancer on women's health, quality of life, and survival rates is significant, and risks include metastasis, decreased fertility, and complications during pregnancy (National Cancer Institute, 2021[2]). However, if detected early, cervical cancer can be effectively treated or even prevented (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021[3]). Therefore, the capacity to predict cervical cancer risk is of utmost importance. The use of predictive models could enable timely interventions and, in conjunction with preventive measures like regular screenings and HPV vaccinations, significantly reduce the incidence and mortality associated with this disease (World Health Organization, 2020[4]).
